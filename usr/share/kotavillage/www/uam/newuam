Page with form in sidebar
Form with hidden fields giving url
Also link to goto page if logged in

Non-JS
Submit form loads in same window to check if correct.
If correct, then redirect to URl and open popup? (Maybe can't open popup without clicking a link, will have to try)

JS
AJAX login, if correct the popup and redirect to URL
May have to open popup first on mouse click?
