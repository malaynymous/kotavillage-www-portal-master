Languages are now stored as 2 letter coded dirs, with Symlinks from the English language name for ease of seeing which languages are what. Languages are managed with Transifex.
----
Languages are stored based on English names. So Afrikaans is stored in the Afrikaans directory. English is stored in the English directory. Etc
French is stored in the French directory, NOT the fran√ßais directory.
You can store things in the 2 letter coded directory, for example fr for French, en for English, but you must have a symlink to the English full name.
This may change at a later date to just 2 letter coded directories, but for now this is easier to see visually which languages are what.
